#  Images
## There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.
## If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.

## Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.

# HTML Images Syntax
## The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

## Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

- The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

*The <img> tag has two required attributes*:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
