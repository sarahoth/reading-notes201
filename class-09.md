#  More CSS Layout

## HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout”

- ```<div>``` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
  - Block level elements
    - ```<h1>```, ```<p>```, ```<ul>```, and ```<li>```
  - Inline elements
    - ```<img>```, ```<b>```, and ```<i>```
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning 
  - Relative
    - Moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
  - Absolute
    - The box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.
  - Fixed
    - Type of absolute positioning 
    - Positions the element in relation to the browser window
    - When a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. 
  - Floated items require a defined width so they don't take up full length of page
  - Using float to place elements side-by-side
    - Height of boxes affects where elements sit
  - Clearing floats (clear: left;)
    - Allows you to say that no element should touch the left or right hand side of a box
  - Creating multi-column layouts with floating
    - Using ```<div>``` to section content, then width, float and margin in CSS to space out content between each other
- Z-index allows you to control which box appears on top.
  - Value of z-index is a number 
  - Higher/larger number will appear over the top of smaller numbers
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts. 
  - Fixed width layouts design
    - Do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
    - Advantages:
      - Accurate pixel values when controlling size and position of elements
      - Far greater control of items appearance and position
      - Control the lengths of lines of text regardless of size
      - Size of image stays the same	
    - Disadvantages
      - Large gaps at ends of pages
      - Higher resolution users can't see text and is hard to read
      - Increase in font size, text might not fit
      - Only works better with devices with similar resolution
      - Takes more vertical space
  - Liquid layouts design
    - Stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window
    - Advantages:
      - Page expands so no spaces around the page
      - Small window, page contracts to fit
      - Tolerant of users setting, larger font sizes
    - Disadvantages
      - If width is not controlled, expected results won't show
      - Wide window causes stretched text
      - Narrow window causes squished text
      - Large image plus small box means overflow
- Designer keeps pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels
  - To demonstrate its relevance without scrolling
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
